# Antheias Garden Part 2

Antheia was walking through a colorful garden and somehow had an odd feeling that there is something missing. There was a tree 🌳, many stones 🪨, even some lizards 🦎 which already found their way into this odoriferous spot.
A pond 🌊! Antheia was powerful enough to wish a tiny pond into existence. Minutes later, ten rainbow trouts 🐟 already found a new home.
There was just a full-moon 🌕 and Antheia could get back when the moon fully shines again. For today Antheia just puts beautiful water lilies into the pond.
50% of the pond are filled with lilies about 500. and they triple every day.
There are 200 (20% full) rainbow trouts are hungry and each eat 1 lily pad a day. They grow at a rate of 4 per day. They nibble all the time.
The sharks 10 (1% full) of them🦈🦈 will each eat 1 trout every day and also every day 5x.
All of them cannot grow more than what they eat and when they get close, their rate decreases proportional to how close they are.
How many water lilies will Antheia see when she returns on the next full-moon 🌕? How many trouts and sharks?
