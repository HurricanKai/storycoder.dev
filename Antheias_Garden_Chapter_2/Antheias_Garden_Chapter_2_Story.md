# Antheias Garden - Chapter 2

After the first full moon Antheia returned to the pond. The life she was
breathing into the body of water obviously had their effects.

But was there another entity visiting this pond? Some flower were lined up in
pattern too unordinatory to be random.

An Iris, a Hibiscus, a Ficaria Verna, a Rudbeckia Hirta, ... The Iris had 3
Petals, the Hibiscus 5 Petals, the Ficaria 8 Petals and it continued like 13,
21, 34, ... All flowers arranged in an almost perfect spiral.

How many petals does the 20th flower have in this arrangement?

<div data-solution="46368"></div>

How many petals does the 100th flower have?

<div data-solution="2427893228399975082453"></div>

But who was this? Is there another goddess making fun of her?

Demeter? The godess of grains. Did she plant this spiral behind her back?

Iris? The first flower she noticed was called after the godess herself. Or maybe
Iris was just bringing an message from another god?

Narcissus? She glanced shortly into the pond, tumbling backwards, then somewhat
shocked by her own thoughts.

Chloris? Through the whispers of the west-wind, she knew that Chloris had an
wonderful garden, filled with flowers from the known and unknown parts of the
whole world.

Antheia saw that many plants followed this pattern, but not all of them. So far
this was just an observation. Was there a reason for this? Something which goes
beyond something even Zeus could imagine?

Antheia was clever. She realized after some time, if she divided the the number
of petals of two flowers following each other, that the ratio seemed to approach
a specific number.

- 5 / 3 = 1.66667
- 13 / 8 = 1.625
- 21 / 13 = 1.61538

What is this number? (with 5 digits of precision)

<div data-solution="1.61803"></div>

Maybe she should ask Athena about this, she was the most clever entitiy she
knew, the most merciless strategista in the olymp. Or Prometheus, ease his pain
for at least some time?
