Darryl in Brussels 

Darryl, the donkey, used to be really famous, on social media, among his mates, he was the star of his family basically. Everyone adored him, worshipped him in extravagant spheres. He of course, went along with it, he proudly marched through the fields, the city, the farms, people bowed at him, animals bowed at him. Yes he was truly a hero for them. 

But one day, out of nothing, he lost his ability to produce money in his stomach! No coins ü™ô ever came out of him again. He started to feel sick, but not because his belly stopped creating money, but because his previously adored family and friends stopped caring about him, turned away from him. 

Darryl felt lonely, and useless. He was strolling pensively along the trottwar, as he stumbled upon an advertisement for an open source tech conference. Excited by the prospect of learning more about technology, Darryl decided to embark on an adventure to attend the conference.

The journey was long and tiring, but Darryl was determined to reach his goal. He crossed many waffle shops, passed innumerable chocolate üç´ confiseries and Belgian fries üçü shops; all sources of countless potential distractions on the way to the open source conference. But he conquered them all, including the tasty beer coming from a somewhat infantile appearing statue. On the way to the conference, he started to feel excited, yes ecstatic, almost like in a delirium. He started briefly hallucinating about amazing wall comics, graffities and street art, but wait, these are real! What an amazing city! The Belgian chocolate was hard to withstand; but when he was thinking about Swiss Chocolate, he could resist the Belgian chocolate, too.

Stopping at the last waffle stand before the conference, he couldn‚Äôt resist, he desperately wanted one. Since he doesn‚Äôt produce nor possess any money anymore to buy a waffle, the waffle seller gave him another option: 

Question:
‚ÄúIf you help me solve the following problem, you can have a free waffle with any toppings you want. Okay, here is the issue: In about an hour, 20 famous open source programmers will be standing in line here for a waffle. I want to decorate special waffles for them with their names on them. The names shall be written with fine Belgian chocolate letters that I bought. I bought four sets of letters (each set has 26 letters of the English Alphabet). I probably won‚Äôt have enough letters to write all their names. In which order shall the programmers stand in line for me to be able to inscribe as many waffles as possible? Here are the programmers‚Äô names:

Dennis, Aaron, Donald, Tim, Bjarne, Linus, Guido, James, Richard, Brian, Grace, Alan, Niklaus, Guy, Fabrice, Donald, Ken, John, Eric, Anders, Alexander, Charles, Alan, Ronald, Andrew, Leslie, Edsger, John, Keith, Barbara
Daryll, the donkey, managed to solve the problem. 


After solving the problem and many distractions on the way, Daryll has reached the conference venue. When he finally arrived, he was awestruck by the sight of hundreds of people gathered to learn and share their knowledge of technology.
Darryl was able to attend various talks and workshops, and he was amazed by the wealth of information and the passion of the attendees. He also met many other animals who shared his love for technology, and he was happy to make new friends.
At the end of the conference, Darryl was inspired to continue his journey of learning. He left the conference with a newfound appreciation for open-source technology and a desire to contribute to the community.
From that day on, Darryl was known as the tech-savvy donkey and was sought after for his knowledge and expertise. He continued to attend tech events and spread his love of technology to others, inspiring a new generation of tech-enthusiasts. He may not produce many or have his old, superficial friends anymore, but he gained the love for technology and many new real friends.
